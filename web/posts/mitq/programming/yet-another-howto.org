* WSL
WSL has two versions: WSL 1 and WSL 2.
WSL 1 - uses a translation layer to convert Linux system calls into Windows ones. As such, running Docker directly in WSL 1 is not possible.
WSL 2 - is required Hyper-V on your Windows computer. 
Hyper-V can lead to some conflicting problems with other VMs, so deciding between WSL 1 and WSL 2 is up to the individual.

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
  > wsl --shutdown #will shut down all running distributions.
  > wsl --terminate <distroName> #to terminate a a specific distribution.
  > systemctl list-unit-files --type=service # show status of servicies
#+END_SRC

** WSL commnds

#+BEGIN_SRC bash

# update wsl 
wsl --update

wsl --version

# Enabling systemd
sudo nano /etc/wsl.conf

# add
[boot]
systemd=true

# shut down all instances of running WSL distributions
wsl --shutdown



#+END_SRC

** Enable ssh to wsl 
#+BEGIN_SRC bash

# install OpenSSH in WSL machine
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install openssh-server

# check service
sudo service ssh status

# start ssh service
sudo systemctl start sshd.service

# verify
ssh arthur@localhost

# change the port number for the Linux SSH server
# we do not want to use the same default port number as the Windows SSH port number to cause any conflict
sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
# And then uncomment and change the Port = 22 to Port = 2222 or any number you prefer.

# allow port forwarding and start service
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo service ssh start

# check the status and confirm the port number is set up correctly
systemctl status ssh.service

# port forward from your Windows system to the WSL subsystem. 
# Since the WSL subsystem has it's IP address network, we first need to find it out:
sudo apt install net-tools
ifconfig

#+END_SRC
